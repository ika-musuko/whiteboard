whiteboard
------------

whiteboard project for cs151

extra features
- duplicate
- reset board
- dynamically adjusting text width
- more columns in the status table

notes
- no models for oval and rect because they're drawn the same way by swing (but those can be added easily)
- canvaslistener to easily implement components that need to listen to the canvas itself (networking, statustable)
- normal text file I/O instead of xml because it's faster and more flexible
